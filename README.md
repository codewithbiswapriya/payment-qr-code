<b>Gratification Page for Creators (100% #no-code) ⚡</b>

Buy me chai gives an opportunity to have a sponsor me page for creators that can be embedded in a website, put up in a bio of an Instagram account or just added to a Medium Blog. This helps their supporters gratify and support their art via sponsoring a cup of tea! Yes it's that simple.

It's an <b>India first product</b> 🇮🇳 and is built on the backbone of <b>UPI payments</b> and thus requires No Integration. Also, since we are creator-first this is absolutely Commission Free (quite literally) 🤘

Buy me chai is a Not for Profit Initiative to help creators get support for their creative projects!
